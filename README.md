# Free-Congestion-Control-Using-OpenGL-
Main aim of this Mini Project is to illustrate the concepts and usage of Congestion Control in OpenGL..

In data networking and queuing theory, network congestion occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data that its quality of service deteriorates When more packets were sent than could be handled by intermediate routers, the intermediate routers discarded many packets, expecting the end points of the network to retransmit the information.

When this packet loss occurred, the end points sent extra packets that repeated the information lost, doubling the data rate sent, exactly the opposite of what should be done during congestion. This pushed the entire network into a 'congestion collapse' where most packets were lost and the resultant throughput was negligible.

The data finds the best shortest route to send data to the destination. Whenever a congestion from a hacker is created the data finds some other best route to send the data to the destination.
